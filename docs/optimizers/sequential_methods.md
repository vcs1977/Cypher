## Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian optimization chooses new positions by calculating the expected improvement of every position in the search space based on a gaussian process that trains on already evaluated solutions.

**Use case/properties:**
- If model evaluations take a long time
- If you do not want to do many iterations
- If your search space is not to big
